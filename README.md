# Train-Schedule

This is a program to calculate when the next train will arrive and how many minutes away that is.

The user inputs a train name, the destination, when the train first starts running and
how frequent the trains run.

Using the time of when the first train starts running and the frequency it calculates how many minutes away
the nex train is. Then it calculates the next train arrival.
